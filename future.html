    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The future of healthcare is being shaped by cutting-edge innovations. AI, robotics, genetic engineering, and immersive technologies are redefining diagnosis, treatment, and prevention—ushering in a new era of personalized, proactive, and data-driven medicine.

  <!-- Emerging Technologies -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Emerging Technologies</h2>

    <h3>Gene Editing (CRISPR)</h3>
    <p>Allows modification of DNA to cure inherited diseases or cancer. Precision gene therapy is becoming a major breakthrough in treatment. Companies like Editas Medicine and CRISPR Therapeutics are already conducting human trials for genetic blindness and sickle cell anemia.</p>

    <h3>Brain-Computer Interfaces</h3>
    <p>Neural interfaces like Neuralink enable brain signal reading to assist patients with paralysis or neurological disorders. Future applications include memory restoration, speech synthesis from thought, and control of prosthetics through neural impulses.</p>

    <h3>AI-Powered Drug Discovery</h3>
    <p>AI models are expediting drug development pipelines by simulating molecular interactions and predicting outcomes. Platforms like DeepMind's AlphaFold and Insilico Medicine are slashing years off traditional R&D cycles.</p>

    <h3>Smart Implants</h3>
    <p>Implants that can monitor, communicate, and adjust in real-time. Used in orthopedics, cardiology, and neurotherapy. Examples include smart pacemakers that adapt to activity levels and orthopedic implants that track bone healing post-surgery.</p>

    <h3>Digital Twins</h3>
    <p>Virtual replicas of patients help simulate treatment plans and predict health risks for personalized care. Hospitals are exploring digital twin models to plan surgeries, optimize ICU workflows, and track long-term treatment response.</p>

    <h3>AR/VR in Healthcare</h3>
    <p>Used for remote surgery, immersive therapy, and medical education through augmented and virtual reality technologies. VR is helping phobia patients undergo exposure therapy, while AR assists surgeons in overlaying CT data during real-time operations.</p>

  <h2>Ongoing Research: NLP for Chronic Disease Monitoring</h2>
  <div class="research-box">
    <p>
      As part of an ongoing research paper, I am conducting a <strong>systematic review of NLP-based tools</strong> used in chronic disease detection and Quality of Life (QoL) monitoring. The analysis spans use cases in diabetes, arthritis, asthma, and cardiovascular disorders.
    </p>
    <p>
      While tools like <strong>Med-BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and GPT-derived medical models</strong> show high potential in extracting clinical insights from unstructured texts, they are primarily used for symptom analysis or document classification—not holistic patient monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key finding:</strong> There exists no <em>fully automated, end-to-end QoL monitoring system</em> using NLP. Most tools are fragmented—either summarizing physician notes or generating partial recommendations without patient-specific historical context.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gap opens up opportunities to develop:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Weekly patient summary generators from daily logs using LLMs</li>
      <li>Symptom trend tracking using time-aware NLP models</li>
      <li>Personalized health alerts and advice powered by contextual embeddings</li>
      <li>QoL dashboards integrated with wearable or voice-assistant inputs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I am currently working on a systematic review exploring the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in chronic disease management, with a focus on Quality of Life (QoL) assessment tools. Preliminary findings suggest that while various NLP-based models have been developed to extract medical insights from patient records and symptom logs, a fully automated, end-to-end QoL monitoring system does not yet exist. This gap presents a valuable opportunity for future innovation in building intelligent assistants that can convert fragmented patient data into structured, personalized health narratives.
